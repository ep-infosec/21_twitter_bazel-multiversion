Trying a new strategy to reconcile versions.

* do an isolated resolution for every explicitly declared dependency
* collect all resolved artifacts by their module
* report errors on any conflicting versions in implicit transitive dependencies
* generate Bazel cross-build from library dependency graph that doesn't violate
  constraints like "no duplicate versions of a given module on the same
  classpath"

This avoids the concept of a "default resolution" since we do an independent resolution for every declared dependency.
